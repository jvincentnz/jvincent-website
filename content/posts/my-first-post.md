This website was created using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.

These are the steps I followed to create a GitHub repository and setup my website using Hugo:

1. From a macOS terminal I installed Hugo using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and then setup a basic Hugo website with the [beautifulhugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/) theme:

		brew install hugo

		hugo new site jvincent-website
		
		cd jvincent-website
		git init 
		git-secrets --install
		git submodule add https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo.git themes/beautifulhugo

1. Create a `.gitignore` file to have the following content:

		# macOS Internals
		.DS_Store
	
		# Website content generated by Hugo build
		/public

1. Edit the `config.toml` file to have the following content:

		baseURL = "http://jeremyvincent.com/"
		languageCode = "en"
		title = "Jeremy Vincent's Website"
	
		theme = "beautifulhugo"
	
		enableGitInfo = true
		[Params]
		  commit = "https://github.com/jvincentnz/jvincent-website/tree/"
	
		[Author]
		  name = "Jeremy Vincent"
		  website = "http://jeremyvincent.com/"
		  email = "jeremy.vincent@gmail.com"
		  facebook = "jeremy.vincent.129794"
		  github = "jvincentnz"
		  #gitlab = "username"
		  #bitbucket = "username"
		  twitter = "jvincentnz"
		  linkedin = "vincentjeremy"
	
		[permalinks]
		  posts = "/:year/:month/:title/"

1. Create the first post by running the following from a macOS terminal:

		hugo new posts/my-first-post.md

1. Edit `posts/my-first-post.md` with your first post content using a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) editor!

1. Test your new static website on your local computer by running the following from the macOS terminal to start the Hugo webserver with draft content enabled:

		hugo server -D

1. And then browse to `http://localhost:1313/` in your web browser.

1. After you have finished testing your website, press `Control-C` to stop the Hugo webserver.

1. Commit your website content to your GitHub repository by running the following from the macOS terminal:
		
		git add .
		git commit -m "Initial commit"
		git remote add origin https://github.com/jvincentnz/jvincent-website.git
		git push
		
1. Create the static website in the `public/` directory by running the following from the macOS terminal:

		hugo -D

1. Now you can publish your static website from the `public/` directory to your S3 website enabled bucket.
