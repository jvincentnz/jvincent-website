description: My first post using Hugo as the static site generator.

This website was created using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.

These are the steps I followed to create a GitHub repository and setup my website using Hugo:

1. From a macOS terminal I installed Hugo using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and then setup a basic Hugo website with my [fork](https://github.com/jvincentnz/beautifulhugo) of the [beautifulhugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/) theme by running:

	```bash
	brew install hugo

	hugo new site jvincent-website
		
	cd jvincent-website
	git init 
	git-secrets --install
	git submodule add https://github.com/jvincentnz/beautifulhugo.git themes/beautifulhugo
1. Create a `.gitignore` file to have the following content:

		# macOS Internals
		.DS_Store
	
		# Website content generated by Hugo build
		/public

1. Create a `README.md` file to describe the GitHub repository.

1. Create a `LICENSE.txt` file for the GitHub repository.

1. Edit the `config.toml` file to have the following content:

		baseURL = "https://jeremyvincent.com/"
		languageCode = "en"
		title = "Jeremy Vincent's Website"
		theme = "beautifulhugo"
		
		pygmentsUseClasses = true
		pygmentsCodeFences = true
		pygmentsCodefencesGuessSyntax = true
		#pygmentsStyle = "monokai"
		#pygmentsUseClassic = true
		#pygmentOptions = "linenos=inline"
		#disqusShortname = "XXX"
		#googleAnalytics = "XXX"
	
		enableGitInfo = true
		[Params]
		  commit = "https://github.com/jvincentnz/jvincent-website/tree/"
		  # homeTitle = "Beautiful Hugo Theme" # Set a different text for the header on the home page
		  # subtitle = "Build a beautiful and simple website in minutes"
		  mainSections = ["post","posts"]
		  # logo = "img/avatar-icon.png" # Expecting square dimensions
		  # favicon = "img/favicon.ico"
		  # dateFormat = "January 1, 2020"
		  # commit = false
		  rss = true
		  # comments = true
		  readingTime = true
		  wordCount = true
		  useHLJS = false
		  socialShare = true
		  # delayDisqus = true
		  showRelatedPosts = true
		  # hideAuthor = true
		  # gcse = "012345678901234567890:abcdefghijk" # Get your code from google.com/cse. Make sure to go to "Look and Feel" and change Layout to "Full Width" and Theme to "Classic"
		
		[Author]
		  name = "Jeremy Vincent"
		  website = "https://jeremyvincent.com/"
		  email = "jeremy.vincent@gmail.com"
		  facebook = "jeremy.vincent.129794"
		  github = "jvincentnz"
		  #gitlab = "username"
		  #bitbucket = "username"
		  twitter = "jvincentnz"
		  linkedin = "vincentjeremy"

		  posts = "/:year/:month/:title/"

1. Run the following from a macOS terminal to [Generate Syntax Highlighter CSS](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#generate-syntax-highlighter-css) for Chroma using Hugo with the `monokai` [style](https://xyproto.github.io/splash/docs/all.html):
	
	```bash
	mkdir static/css
	hugo gen chromastyles --style=monokai > static/css/syntax.css
1. Create the first post by running the following from a macOS terminal:

	```bash
	hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
1. Edit `posts/my-first-post.md` with your first post content using a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) editor!

1. Test your new static website on your local computer by running the following from the macOS terminal to start the Hugo webserver with draft content enabled:

	```bash
	hugo server -D
1. And then browse to `http://localhost:1313/` in your web browser.

1. After you have finished testing your website, press `Control-C` to stop the Hugo webserver.

1. Update the `draft: true` field in your first post `posts/my-first-post.md` file to be `draft: false` so it will be published when running `hugo` without the draft content enabled option:

		---
		title: "My First Post"
		date: 2020-04-11T15:01:31+12:00
		draft: false
		---

1. Commit your website content to your GitHub repository by running the following from the macOS terminal:
	
	```bash
	git add .
	git commit -m "Initial commit"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/jvincentnz/jvincent-website.git
	git push -u origin master
1. Create the static website content in the `public/` directory by running the following from the macOS terminal:  
	**NOTE:** Only content marked *non-draft* will be generated.

	```bash
	hugo
1. Now you can publish your static website from the `public/` directory to your S3 website enabled bucket.
