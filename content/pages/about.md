Hello, I'm Jeremy Vincent and I work as a Senior Technical Account Manager at Amazon Web Services. All opinions expressed are my own.

This is my website, it's mainly used to tinker with technology.

This website was created using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator. It uses [Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html), [Amazon CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html), [AWS Lambda@Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-at-the-edge.html) and [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) to serve the static website content generated by Hugo.
